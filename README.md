- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sanderphilipse.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things Typescript, functional reactive programming and the Flux paradigm.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at sanderphilipse@gmail.com.

I have two projects that may be of particular interest. 
- [DSMR Reader](https://github.com/sanderphilipse/dsmr-reader) is a program I built to teach myself Rust, and to retrieve second-by-second energy and gas consumption readings from Dutch electronic metering devices. It sends the results to a Prometheus database. I also used a somewhat basic multi-threading approach in this project.
- [NgRx-Tetris](https://github.com/sanderphilipse/ngrx-tetris) is a version of Tetris built in Angular that uses NgRx to execute almost all of its logic. There's about 11 lines of HTML in there, and an Angular component with a few one-line methods. Everything else is handled in NgRx. I used this as a showcase to demonstrate the possibilities of NgRx and the Flux/Redux paradigm.
